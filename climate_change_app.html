    <p>Climate change is a long-term change in the Earth's weather, mainly caused by people burning fuels like coal, oil, and gas. This releases gases that trap heat in the air, making the planet warmer. It can lead to things like rising sea levels, stronger storms, and harm to animals and plants.</p>
